# LIME

LIME is a tool to make machine learning models explainable.  It is a blackbox
algorithm that simply requires a function that will generate the output of the
model for given input.


## What is it?

1. `wine_and_lime.ipynb`: application of LIME to a random forest classification
   model for a Kaggle dataset on the quality of white wine.
1. `data`: directory containing the data.
