#| Source code

This is source code that is either used in the presentation, or was developed
to create it.  There is some material not covered in the presentation as well.

## Requirements

* Python version: at least 3.7
* Packages (names listed that can be used with `pip` or `conda` to install):
  * pandas
  * xlrd
  * seaborn
  * matplotlib
  * scipy
  * jupyter
  * scikit-learn
  * keras
  * hyperopt

## What is it?
* [`keras`](keras): illustration of using Keras for machine learning.
* [`parameter-optimization`](parameter-optimization): example of parameter
  optimization kusing hyperopt, although the examples do not optimize
  hyperparameters in machine learning, that would be very similar.
* [`scikit-learn`](scikit-learn): examples of scikit-learn for machine learning,
  examples are provided forsupervised (regression and classification) and
  unsupervised (clustering) learnign, as well as dimensionality reduction for
  visualization of high-demensional data.
