Machine learning plays an increasingly important role in many scientific
domains.  A Python programmer can use high-quality machine learning
frameworks for classic machine learning as well as for state-of-the-art
algorithms.

This training concentrates on methodological and practical aspects of
machine learning and how to apply those using Python.

## Learning outcomes

When you complete this training you will

  * understand what supervised and unsupervised learning are;
  * understand the workflow required for supervised learning;
  * be able to implement that workflow in scikit-learn;
  * know how to use algorithms in scikit-learn such as ridge regression
    and naive Bayes classification;
  * be able to apply k-means clustering;
  * understand the main concepts in deep neural networks;
  * be able to apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to an image
    classification task;
  * understand the concepts underpinning word embeddings;
  * be able to use recurrent network architectures such as 
    long short term memory (LSTM) to natural language problems;
  * be aware of best practices and pitfalls in machine learning.

## Target audience

This training is for you if you need to use Python for machine learning
applications.


## Prerequisites

You will need experience programming in Python.  This is not a training that starts
from scratch.  Familiarity with numpy is not required, but would be beneficial.
Familiarity with numpy, pandas and matplotlib is strongly recommended.

If you plan to do Python programming in a Linux or HPC environment you should
be familiar with these as well.
